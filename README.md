**Findings and recommendations**
 **Service Availability**-Cities with high table bookings: Cities like Abu Dhabi, Bangalore, Chennai, and Mumbai have a notable number of table bookings, indicating that customers prefer dining in-person in these areas.
Cities with high online bookings: Abu Dhabi, Gurgaon, New Delhi, and Mumbai are major hubs for online delivery bookings, which suggests a higher demand for convenience or limited in-person dining.Focus on cities with higher demand: Invest in expanding service availability (both online and table booking) in cities with high online delivery demand such as Abu Dhabi, Gurgaon, and Mumbai.
**Geographic Heatmap**-Major cities like New Delhi, Gurgaon, and Mumbai have a large concentration of restaurants and likely represent a large portion of the customer base.
Cities with few restaurants (e.g., Balingup, Bandung, Vernonia) may represent untapped opportunities or niche markets.Expand in high-density areas: Focus on cities with a high concentration of restaurants (e.g., Gurgaon, New Delhi) for further expansion and targeted marketing.
**Restaurant Distribution by Countries and Cities**-The data indicates that India has the largest number of restaurants by far, with 8652 restaurants, followed by Brazil with 60, and UAE with 60 restaurants as well.The country with the highest restaurant concentration is India, with major cities like New Delhi (5473), Gurgaon (1118), and Noida (1080) dominating the list.Several countries like Australia, South Africa, and United Kingdom have smaller distributions, with some cities like Balingup, Mohali, and Clatskanie having only one restaurant. 
Focus on high-density areas: In countries like India, Brazil, and UAE, restaurants should focus on expanding or improving services in cities with high restaurant density to cater to the large customer base.
**Price Range and Ratings**-The average aggregate rating tends to increase with higher price ranges. Specifically:
Price Range 1 (low): 2.00 rating (4444 votes)
Price Range 2: 2.94 rating (3113 votes)
Price Range 3: 3.68 rating (1408 votes)
Price Range 4 (high): 3.82 rating (586 votes)
Evaluate price sensitivity: Investigate how restaurant ratings correlate with price range in each region and city. Higher ratings may reflect customer satisfaction with premium services, but low-priced establishments should aim to enhance quality to improve customer ratings.

Sum of Votes: While the Dine-in category has higher votes (9,80,731), the Online Delivery category has fewer votes (5,17,914), but still holds a better rating.
Focus on online delivery: Given the higher ratings, restaurants should explore further improvements in online delivery services, including faster deliveries, better packaging, and a broader range of delivery options.
Improve in-restaurant experience: The lower ratings for dine-in services indicate a need for improvement in customer experience. Consider revising the menu, interior design, customer service, and overall ambiance in dine-in locations.
